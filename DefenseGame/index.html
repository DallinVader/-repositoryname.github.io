  <p>To play the game use W and S to move down and Spacebar to shoot a fireball. Every time you hit an enemy with your fireball the gauge on the bottom called malice will grow and you can use special abilities. Press E to create 3 fireballs which take a bit of malice and you can press R to create a boulder that takes out an entire line of enemies but uses a lot of malice.</p>
